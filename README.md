# Introduction
==============
The Search Party API is developed using a RESTful Architecture. Representational State Transfer (or REST) is used in a client-server set up. The REST API allows the user to manipulate the state of the application by clicking on links. Each click results in a change in the state of the application.

The advantage of using a RESTful API is it easily integrates with the existing code. Very few changes need to be made to existing functions or code. All changes to the application are made by API calls.

However, before you can use the API in your applications, you will need to acquire an API Key.

# API-Integration
=================

## Getting a Search Party API Key

1. Login and go to your Application List on the Search Party site: <http://www.thesearchparty.com/settings/api>
2. Click the "Add Application" link near the top of the page.
3. Fill out the form to generate a **Consumer Key** and a **Consumer Secret**:
   - "Application Name" can be anything - preferably the name of the application being developed that will use the api data.
   - "Company URL" should be the url of the website displaying api data.
   - "oAuth Callback Domain" can be the same as Company URL (it isn't currently used but will be once 3 legged authentication is added in the future).

localitybestmatch will return something even if you only pass in a countryid. However, it is recommended not to leave it at that. You will get better results if you also pass in a stateid, suburb, and postcode. The more information you pass in, the more accurate will be the results.</td>
